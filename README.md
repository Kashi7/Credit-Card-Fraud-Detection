Credit Card Fraud Detection using machine learning
Throughout the financial sector, machine learning algorithms are being developed to detect fraudulent transactions.
In this project, that is exactly what we are going to be doing as well.
In this project, I have builded and deployed the following two machine learning algorithms:
Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
Isolation Forest Algorithm
Furthermore, using metrics suchs as precision, recall, and F1-scores, we will investigate why the classification accuracy 
for these algorithms can be misleading.
